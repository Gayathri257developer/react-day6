    <h2>1. What is event in react js?</h2>
    <p>Event just like html DOM eventin react. it can perform action based on user events. <br />
        EX: onClick, onChange, etc <br />
        Events written in camelCase. event handler written inside { } curly braces. <br>
        to pass an argument to an event handler, we use a arrow function.</p>

    <h2>3. What you prefer function based or class component and why? </h2>
    <p>I, used to prefer function component. because function is better then class component. <br>
        function doesn't have render method / constructor.
        <br> its is a plain javascript function
        <br> it accepts props and return JSX. <br>
        it follows the hooks concepts. <br>
        it is stateless component.
        <br> it has simple syntax. and easy to learn.

    <h2>4. How reducer as pure function in redux ?</h2>
    <p>In redux, a reducer is a pure function. these function accepts 2 arguments state and action. it always return a new
        state based on
        action, does not change the existing state. </p>
    <hr>
    <h2>5. Why we use redux thunk?</h2>
    <p>It allows us to dispatch actions manually, which gives us the power to incorporate some logic or run some
        asynchronous code before
        dispatching an action.
    </p>

    <h2>6. What do you know about NPM ?</h2>
    <p>Node uses a node package manager or an NPM to install all new updates and packages. Node bundles single applications 
        built through React to simplify the compilation process</p>
